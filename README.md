# simple_nn
A very basic neural network. Created as a tutorial mostly.
To give a bit of context (as this is a tutorial):
* You are a teacher.
* You have 3 students.
* Student 1 is the brightest.
* Student 2 is less bright than 1.
* Student 3 is less bright than 2.
* You are giving them a test of 10 questions.
* You would like to classify whether they are cheating or not.
